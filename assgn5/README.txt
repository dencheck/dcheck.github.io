Extra work: 

I created 4 product detail pages to enhance my site. Each of the four categories on the shop page link to a distinct detail page with its own title, image and color button checked. The featured pillows on the home page also link to distinct product pages respectively. 

I went to great lengths to implement responsiveness in my site. I used CSS grid to lay out elements such that the site collapses or expands to accommodate different window sizes. 

I created a custom FluffnStuff logo to enhance the realism of the site and help unify the modern aesthetic.
